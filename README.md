#About social-closeness
The purpose of this project is to implement a RESTful web server to allow clients to analyse social closeness by adding new relations (or edges) between people and get the rank of the most "close" people. This ranks how close each person is to each other person in the network. 
Also, there is the possibility to set a node as "fraudulent", which will impact on the closeness of him and all people who relate to him.

#The Project
The project was developed in Clojure. This is my first project in a pure functional language
